### Introduction 

The purpose of our project is to better understand how the public feels about key issues in regards to Trump and Biden using tweets regarding the 2020 election. The model we designed could be used to measure support for either Trump and Biden in the upcoming election, giving insight into how different demographics of Americans feel about certain issues. Using a kaggle dataset from the 2020 election, we will measure public sentiment for three of the most divisive issues in the US today: abortion, immigration, and gun control. We will visualize a percentage of the tweets that support Trump and Biden for each of the respective topics. 
In typical polls, there is a large degree of self-selection bias, leading to inaccurate polls that fail to represent the true feelings of the American public. So if we are able to accurately predict which candidate a tweet supports, we can then measure public sentiment on a much larger scale, which could potentially be more representative of public opinion than traditional polls. 
There has also been a surprising lack of social media sentiment analysis to help predict and analyze elections. Additionally, there are no large datasets with labeled data on political sentiment, so our model could ideally provide accurate labeling for large datasets.
